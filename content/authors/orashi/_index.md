I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Electrical & Information Engineering, The University of Sydney, where I work at 
the [SIGMA Lab](https://sigmalab-usyd.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) 
and [Prof. Luping Zhou](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/luping.zhou.php). Before that, I received my B.Eng. 
degree in Software Engineering and B.A. dual degree in Japanese from the International School of Information Science & Engineering, 
Dalian University of Technology in 2019.
